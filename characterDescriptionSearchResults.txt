C#
* the wayward child of Microsoft from a java sperm donation who is constantly trying to be lured into linux's van with mono candy
* He is child of C++ and Java and gets his food and resources from one company
* an ex-teacher, former colleague of Java; quit his teaching gig a decade ago and is now head of department at a large corporation. He's a
  helpful person, and very skilled in a lot of things; his explanations can be lengthy though, and he's a bit too proud of his current
  employer and their corporate identity.

C++
* the oldie but the goodie
* likes controlling everything (your memory included)
* Giant Technological-Advanced Mutant which is at same time is cyborg, monster, alien, human, dog, cat, wolf, deer, bear, chameleon, and
  snake
* Originally a craftsman, this ADHD-ridden maniac tried to learn every craft simultaneously, and he'll take any odd job you throw at him,
  from mopping the floor to building a skyscraper. Talking to him is kind of a challenge though, because he talks fast, and he'll present
  you with all sorts of choices that you never thought existed, let alone were relevant.

HTML
* He isn't human,he is alien,but for some reason everyone considers him as "Human"

JavaScript
* the young kid that nobody takes seriously till the 3rd movie in the series, and he finally gets a storyline of its own, demonstrating he
  matured (but still can't do math)
* Javascript would be a street-wise teenager who lurks in the web-covered side streets; helping the occasional passerby make sense of the
  road signs and stopping them from taking one way streets in the wrong direction. He has two dogs called HTML and CSS that he and his
  beautiful girlfriend (named JQuery) groom and train to do tricks with one another.
  In all, he's not that understood or respected by older members of society that he takes advice from occasionally. They infantalise him
  and say he has no 'class', but he gets by just fine! He's no longer a gimmicky child. Instead, an adult that prays to ECMA three times a
  day. His cousin Jscript passed away and now his other cousin Actionscript is on his deathbed too. :(
* Former liberal arts major with great prospects, born into a family of bohemian artists, but forced to drop out of art school and into
  making a living as a shop window decorator due to circumstances. She's still dreaming of that art career, but being the only window
  decorator in town, and hindered by her inability to do two things simultaneously, she's stuck in that job, although recently she has been
  offered a few gigs as an interior designer which didn't go badly at all. The pay is good, and she's popular, so that art career will
  probably never get off the ground. Her drinking might become a problem at some point, but so far she seems rather stable.
* A tangled mess of tubes
  * A tangled mess of tubes and jQuery

Java
* PHP's the wanton woman who'll sleep with anyone, but if you know her tricks you can get her to do what you want.
  * No, that's Java
* He treats everything as objects,absolutely everything. He does something once and shows off that one thing everywhere. Before, he was
  leaving so much garbage that Universe would eventually crash,but he stopped being a jerk and leaving garbage.
* a retired teacher, ever so patient, very experienced, and knows a lot about a lot of things. She's quite protective, but somewhat out of
  touch with the modern world. Living with Java can be frustrating, because her explanations are lengthy, and for something as simple as
  making a cup of tea, Java uses a tea bag factory, a cup manager, and a heat provider adapter, and she insists that visitors subscribe to
  some sort of event just to tell when the water is boiling. Convincing her of new ways is tiresome and doesn't always go well.

Python
* Wingmanning? No probs. Another round of beers? Sure thing. Old lady struggeling with her groceries? He'll help her. Who is this man, you
  ask? Python. Good old Python.
* the rockstar that has a PhD and is also a sensitive man
* that super handy neighbor who has a tool for everything that makes work around the house super easy
  * Python is more of the Ned Flanders neighbor.
* the guy who doesn't do the fanciest work, but he's got a million ways to get shit done
* It is guy which is lazy as heck and imports everything from other people.
* Spoiled trust fund kiddie and self-proclaimed artist. Has all sorts of high-and-mighty talks about explicit being better than implicit,
  but "borrows" your stuff without asking. When confronted about the matter, he'll say something like "look, we're all consenting adults
  here", or "you see it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission". And forgive him you do, because other than that, he's really a fun
  guy to hang out with. Just don't trust him with your car keys.
